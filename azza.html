          <li>
            <h3>Predicting Corn Yield for Precision Agriculture using Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>For this research, we use supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the number of corn yields a country is going to produce based on the features that we have set. The features are Year (2009 - 2019), Countries that have planted corn, Yield of corn produced per hectare, Rainfall calculated in millimeters, Pesticides used in tons, and Fertilizer of NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) used in kilograms per hectare.</p>
          </li>

            <h3>Math Quiz Application</h3>
            <p>This project is to fulfill the requirements of my OOP class. To achieve this, I decided to develop a Java quix application with GUI that aims to not only challenge users but also provide them with and entertaining experience.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>The Flower Management System</h3>
            <p>The Flower Management System is a user-friendly software solution designed to streamline the process of managing and tracking flower inventory. This system aims to provide an efficient and reliable means of organizing flower data, including their names, prices, and quantities, within a data structure.</p>
