            <h3>Project 1: Predicting Corn Yield for Precision Agriculture using Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>Description: In this project, our study aims to predict corn yields based on features such as year, countries cultivating corn, yield per hectare, rainfall, pesticide usage, and fertilizer application. Among the machine learning models tested, Random Forest emerges as the most suitable for predicting corn yields accurately.

            <h3>Project 2: StockUp (Grocery Management System)</h3>
            <p>Description: In this project, we made a grocery management system so that its easier to keep track of all the products on the shelves, since there is so much to the point where itâ€™s difficult to manage it manually. We  make sure to have a good system, making sure that everything will run smoothly and all the items that are sold off and retrieved will be noted.

            <h3>Project 3: Maze Solver by using Breadth First Search vs Depth First Search </h3>
            <p>Description: In this project, we find out which algorithm is better to solve mazes, and how it can help in our daily lives
