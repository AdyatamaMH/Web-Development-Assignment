            <h3>Project 1 : tetris</h3>
            <p>I created a game of tetris from scratch using the python language it also has a start menu with two buttons, The first button is the start button and the seccond one is the quit button so to instantly back out of the game.The game also has custom backgrounds you can pick to match your style, and randomly generated tetris pieces, The colors will also be randomized so to make the game feel endless. (i forgot my old github acc so i dont have the code).</p>

            <h3>Project 2 : Restaurant Resgister calculator</h3>
            <p>I created a cash register for managing orders and calculating the orders total value using python, This program uses has buttons with the pictures of the items so that it is very accessible, it will also say the item's price at the botrtom of the button. This program will also generate a receipt that will show the user each item's value, and combined value, and it will also add the tax ammount to the total value.</p>
