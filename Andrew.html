        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey there, I'm Andrew Sebastian Sibuea. You can call me Andrew. I'm a bit of a jack-of-all-trades, always dipping my toes into different pools of knowledge and expertise. From delving into the depths of quantum mechanics to crafting poetry that dances on the edge of avant-garde, I thrive on the thrill of exploration and discovery. My mind is constantly buzzing with ideas, and I love nothing more than diving headfirst into new challenges. So, whether I'm tinkering away in my laboratory or scribbling furiously in my notebook, I'm always on the lookout for the next big adventure. Come along for the ride as I navigate the fascinating intersection of science, art, and everything in between. </p>

            <h3>2048 Game</h3>
            <p>2048 is a single-player puzzle game where the goal is to combine numbered tiles on a grid to create a tile with the number 2048. The game starts with a 4x4 grid with two randomly placed tiles, each with the number 2. On each turn, the player can move all tiles in one of the four directions (up, down, left, right) and when two tiles with the same number touch each other, they merge into one tile with the value of the sum of the two tiles. The game is won when a tile with the number 2048 is created, and the game is lost when there are no more possible moves. The game is known for its simple yet addictive gameplay, as well as it's potential to teach problem-solving and logical thinking. 1</p>

            <h3>FSM - Virtual Final Project (Automatic Recycling Vending Machine)</h3>
            <p>The code simulates the behavior of an automatic recycling vending machine. When the program is run, it repeatedly prompts the user to enter a button input of either 0 or 1. If the user enters 0, the machine's door remains closed and the program continues to prompt for input. If the user enters 1, the machine's door opens, and the program then simulates the insertion of an item into the machine. The machine then randomly decides to either accept or reject the item, and displays the corresponding message ("Machine accepts" or "Machine rejects"). After the item has been processed, the program prompts the user to repeat the process with new inputs. The whole process is designed for an automatic recycling vending machine project.
